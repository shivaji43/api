**shape interviewer** is an ai-powered platform for practicing interviews using the [shapes api](https://shapes.inc). it simulates realistic, sometimes uncomfortably honest, interview scenarios and gives feedback to help you get better.

## 🌐 live demo

👉 https://shapeinterview.vercel.app/

## 🚀 features

- technical, behavioral, and leadership interviews
- difficulty scaling (like a boss battle)
- text + voice support
- markdown-enabled answers
- custom interview creation
- ai feedback tuned to your responses
- dark/light mode
- responsive layout

## 🧠 how it works

- shapes from the shapes api simulate different interviewer types
- you chat via text or talk out loud
- for voice: audio → [vercel blob](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-blob) → transcript → ai judgment

## 🔒 privacy

- voice uploads are temp-only
- no sharing/selling of data
- no shady analytics
