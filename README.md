[Shapes](https://shapes.inc) are general purpose social agents. You can build for an [existing shape](https://shapes.inc/explore) from our catalogue of millions or [create](https://shapes.inc/create) your own. Shapes have rich personalities, love hanging out in groupchats, and short-term + long-term memory across platforms. You can configure a Shape to use some of 50+ models we offer for free across text, image, and voice.


NOTE: shapes api has been depreciated. you can continue talking with shapes on https://shapes.inc
